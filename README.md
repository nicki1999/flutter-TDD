The prerequisite of developing Hamvarzeshi application is learning TDD decipline's concepts as well as developing a prototype by applying this decipline.

Why TDD decipline?
To understand why TDD is being used, consider this example of how much time and energy is spent on debugging during the day. Using tdd, which is a kind of decipline, this time is greatly reduced.Tests are being used in this decipline, the reason why we do not sort the messy code is that we are afraid to wreck it, but with using the tests, we find out that there are not any problems with our code, and in case of damage and viewing the messy code, we can fix the code immediately and easily make any desired changes.
The concepts being used:
1.Entities<br>
2.Usecases
3.Interface adapters
4.MVC structure
5.Frameworks and drivers
6.Abstraction
7.Dependency injection
8.Constructor injection
9.Method injection
10.Loosely coupled
11.Tight coupled
12.Dependency inversion principle
13.Inversion of control
14.Features(Data,Domain,Presentation)
15.API
16.State
17.Bloc(state management)
18.Functional programming
19.Callable classes
20.Serialization
21.Deserialization
23.Authorization and Authentication
24.Autogenerate models in Swagger
25.Factory
26.HTTP errors
